*Lab 1 - Pointers*
Task: Create a program that declares an integer variable and a pointer to it. Modify the value of the variable using the pointer and display both the variable and pointer values.

(Explanation: A pointer (ptr) is used to modify the value of num by dereferencing it with *ptr. Both the variable's value and the pointer's value are printed.)


*Lab 2 - Big O Notation (Loops and Arrays)*
Task: Implement a function that finds the maximum value in an array of size n. Determine its time complexity and explain why it is O(n).  

(Explanation: A loop iterates over each element of the array, comparing them to find the maximum. The time complexity is O(n) because we traverse the entire array once.)

*Lab 3 - Singly Linked List (Insert at End, Insert at Start)*  
Task: Implement a singly linked list with functions to insert a node at the start and at the end. Display the list after each insertion.  

Explanation: The program defines a Node structure. The insertAtStart function inserts at the beginning, while insertAtEnd appends a new node at the end.
 The display function prints the list.
 
 
 
*Lab 4 - Singly Linked List (Insert at Specific Location)*  
Task: Write a function to insert a node at a specific position in a singly linked list, ensuring valid position handling.  


Explanation: It traverses the list until it reaches the specified position, then inserts the node there. 
It handles edge cases like inserting at the start or at an invalid position.



*Lab 5 - Singly Linked List (Display Nodes)*  
Task: Implement functions to display the first node, last node, Nth node, and centre node of a singly linked list.



Explanation: Functions are implemented to print the first, last, Nth, and center nodes of the list. 
The center node is computed by traversing halfway through the list.


*Lab 6 - Singly Linked List (Delete Nodes)*  
Task: Implement functions to delete the first node, last node, Nth node, and centre node of a singly linked list.
output'20'

Explanation: Functions delete the first or last node. For deleting the Nth or center node, 
the list is traversed to find and remove the node at the specified position.


*Lab 7 - Doubly Linked List (Insert & Display Nodes)*  
Task: Implement functions to insert node at first, last, Nth location, and centre of a doubly linked list. And display in order and display in reverse order.


Explanation: A doubly linked list is created where each node points to both the next and previous nodes. Insertion functions add nodes at the start and end
. Display functions show the list in both forward and reverse order.


*Lab 8 - Merge two LinkedLists*  
Task: 
1. Create 2 Singly LinkedLists and Merge them and display them.
2. Create 2 Double LinkedLists and Merge them and display them.

Explanation: The merge function combines two singly linked lists by inserting nodes from both lists into a new list. The merged list is then displayed.


*Lab 9 - Circular Linked List (Insert & Display Nodes)*  
Task: Implement functions to insert node at first, last, Nth location, and centre of a circular linked list. And display in order and display in reverse order.


Explanation: A circular linked list is created where the last node points back to the first node. Insertions are made both at the start and end, ensuring the list remains circular. 
The list is displayed by iterating until we return to the starting node.
